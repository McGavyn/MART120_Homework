    <h2><a id="eyedraw">What is the Occult?</a></h2>
    <br>
When you think of the occult, what comes to mind? Take your time, it is an odd topic. 
<br> 
I imagine one thing that may be consistent across interpretations is something supernatural. In reality, it is humorous how much the occult taps into the fundamental pieces of our lives. 
The occult arts are merely ways of viewing the world. According to occultists, it is seeing into the invisible world and plucking at intangible strings. 
Occultism has been used throughout the history of mankind. It is invoked for both sinister and benevolent ends, but it has rarely been accepted by society. Thus, occultism is often practiced in strict secrecy.

<h2><a style="color: midnightblue;">What is its purpose?</a></h2>
The occult arts have many purposes that primarily stem from their user's intentions. Based upon such intentions, the user would invoke one or some of the relevant Principles. Principles are vast forces that permeate our world, and occultists tap into them to perform rites or spells.
<br>
It can be used in some of the following ways:
<ul>
    <li>Beckoning entities from the invisible world into our own</li>
    <li>Protecting yourself or others from otherworldly, or worldly, forces</li>
    <li>Cursing or blessing others</li>
    <li>Contacting higher powers (Hours, otherwise referred to as gods)</li>
</ul>
