## Final Project

### What is it?
I want to create a relaxing experience that is also visually stimulating. First, I imagine soothing background music playing alongside the game. Then, I picture the screen being filled with small shapes that float around the screen, each of them would slowly change colors as they move around. These shapes could act as things that the character needs to grab for points. I also envision the user controlling a character that needs to avoid dark shapes that give them a game over, or maybe subtract a 'heart' and a chunk of points. As time goes on, things will become more difficult, colorful shapes would appear less often, and dark shapes more often and more aggressively. I can also see a point threshhold, where an exit spawns for the player if they collect X amount of points. They would need to touch the exit to fully win the match. I plan on containing all of this code into functions, so only functions will be called in the draw function. 

### Inspirations
I was inspired for this project by Marcus Milyko's broswer based game, for the points, and Lindsey Sewell's fireflies, for the floating objects. Our previous assignment that needed an exit also gave me the idea for a final objective after reaching X points. 

### Problems/new techniques
I believe that I'm going to have issues with connecting music into the program. I have really enjoyed using the p5.js editor to verify my code as I move through it, but I do not see how that'll mesh with testing the music. I plan on incorporating arrays into the project to make the colorful and black shapes possible in mass, but I have never utilized that coding before. I have also not incorporated a point tracker or point-conditioned appearance of something before. I'm also going to need to figure out how to made the color changing possible, especially with all of the shapes. Lastly, I am a procrastinator, so it will be a struggle to space the project out into pieces. 

### Work Plan
    1. incorporate the music, background, and character - by 4/26
    2. write the code for the shape arrays and color changing dynamic - by 4/29
    3. create the code for dark shapes, point tracker, and how the shapes affect the points - 5/1
    4. write code for the good and bad shapes increasing in difficulty as time passes - 5/2
    5. write code for the exit appearing at X amount of points, put all of the functions into the draw function - 5/3

### This Week's Effort
I have created a character that moves around, little circles that rapidly change color and move around the screen randomly, black squares that also move around the screen randomly, and a text that should (but isn't) display a score
