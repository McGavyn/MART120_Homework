I found myself valuing his lesson from football practices. He mentioned how our critics are the ones who still care about us. I feel like that is a very positive message to be sharing. At my current job with Starbucks, I still struggle with making drinks, and I've been working with them for a year. I've usually struggled with one of my coworkers giving overtly critical advice, but I have never considered it a sign of care. I still do not know if it is, but it felt like a potential reality. I've also never been comfortable with criticism. I want to do things right the first time or rarely give it a chance. While his message on criticism won't change my mind over night, I do think it was something I needed to hear given my past. Another thing that struck me was giving people time. I struggle with having patience for people, in numerous areas of my life. It's something that I should really improve, and Randy's comment appealed to me. It made me think about the lost potential for people to surprise me. I identified most with Randy's message on helping others. It spoke to my career goal and parts of my personality. I want to become a grief counselor, so that tied in the strongest to me as a person. I also felt like, in a way, Randy showed how he was helping others. He talked about the different programs that sprung up from his efforts. Each of those helps people in different ways. I am thinking of the college course "Building Virtual Worlds". He may have enabled the dreams of hundreds of people, and that would've been when it first started. The good that is still coming out of the one idea is powerful to me. It sets an admirable example of helping others. I think it connects to what I want out of my career. I wish to create something that helps as many people as possible. If nothing else, I want to help as many people as possible. Randy's message and presentation of past deeds connected to my hope.
