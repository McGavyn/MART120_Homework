GUI and CLI are similar in that they both allow users to manipulate programs. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is more visual in display. It uses pictures to guide users and promotes direct interaction. To clarify, you would be clicking on a file in your 'file explorer' app to open it. However, the CLI (Command Line Interface) is more text operated. It doesn't display pictures and requires text based commands to function. You wouldn't be clicking on anything in CLI to make it function. Rather, you would be putting in commands and running them through the interface. For instance, if you wanted to access a file through the CLI, then you would be typing out the correct command to bring you into that file. I believe game icons on your home screen are also part of the GUI. Therefore, if you didn't or couldn't put the icons up, then you would need to access the specific file that has your game in it. However, you could use the CLI to execute the game file. Conclusion, you could run a game program through the icon on your home screen, or you could type out a command to launch it.
