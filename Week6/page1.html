        <h1>The Principles</h1>
        The purpose of this content is to give a brief description of the different Principles.
        <br>
        <h3>What are Principles?</h3>
        Principles are different driving forces of reality. They are fundamental to existence in a similar fashion as death and life. 
        <br>
        <h3>Why Do They Matter?</h3>
        The significance of Principles is immediately relevant in occult lore and practices. If one doesn't understand the principles, then meddling in occultism will be futile and dangerous. Knowledge of them will inform both occult practices and foreworn practitioners of their dangers.
