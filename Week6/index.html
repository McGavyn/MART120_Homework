        <h1>World of the Occult</h1>

    <h2>What is the Occult?</h2>
    <br>
When you think of the occult, what comes to mind? Take your time, it is an odd topic. 
<br> 
I imagine one thing that may be consistent across interpretations is something supernatural. In reality, it is humorous how much the occult taps into the fundamental pieces of our lives. 
The occult arts are merely ways of viewing the world. According to occultists, it is seeing into the invisible world and plucking at intangible strings.
